## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

I built this using modern accessiblity HTML tags and best practices for layouts using CSS

## Optimizations

- I probably could add a transition for the hover states just to make them more appealing to the eye

## Lessons Learned:

- Always make sure you check for box sizing when building a site. I realised later that my measurements were all wrong. Thankfully was able to correct all the errors.
